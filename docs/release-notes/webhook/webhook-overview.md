# Webhooks Overview

Fiserv webhooks is a method to receive event notifications. Those notifications inform you about specific events that occur either within your payment processing systems or are passed through from external actors.

A webhook is an HTTP-based callback (push) function for web application-driven communication. This push function is initiated when a predefined event occurs. Unlike the traditional request-response model, where a server must continually poll another server for a specific data, a webhook delivers data automatically in real time. Using webhooks, our system immediately transfers a message to you in real time when a predefined event occurs.

Events are generated for non-monetary changes on Fiserv Card Services. Push notifications are sent to the subscriber endpoint. Subscribers can choose event notifications after contract/onboarding the Fiserv "Event Streaming â€“ Webhook" product.

Notifications are sent in the form of events that have a predefined structure to an endpoint. Events can be:

 * Information-only which require no specific action.
 * Time-sensitive that require your action within a predefined time interval.
