# Webhooks Overview

Fiserv webhooks is a method to receive event notifications. Those notifications inform you about specific events that occur either within your payment processing systems or are passed through from external actors.

A webhook is an HTTP-based callback (push) function for web application-driven communication. This push function is initiated when a predefined event occurs. Unlike the traditional request-response model, where a server must continually poll another server for a specific data, a webhook delivers data automatically in real time. Using webhooks, our system immediately transfers a message to you in real time when a predefined event occurs.

Events are generated for non-monetary changes on Fiserv Card Services. Push notifications are sent to the subscriber endpoint. Subscribers can choose event notifications after contract/onboarding the Fiserv "Event Streaming – Webhook" product.

Notifications are sent in the form of events that have a predefined structure to an endpoint. Events can be:

 * Information-only which require no specific action.
 * Time-sensitive that require your action within a predefined time interval.

After submitting your subscription request, a Fiserv team reviews and approves your subscription request. Once approved, the webhook subscription is set up based on the information supplied. Look for webhook subscription approvals, rejections, or event notifications in the email defined in your subscription request. You may also receive news at that email address if there are issues with the webhook URL or health check URL.
