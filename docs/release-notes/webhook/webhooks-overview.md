# Webhooks Overview

Fiserv webhooks is a method to receive event notifications. Those notifications inform you about specific events that occur either within your payment processing systems or are passed through from external actors.

Notifications are sent in the form of events that have a predefined structure to an endpoint. Events can be:

 * Information-only which require no specific action.
 * Time-sensitive that require your action within a predefined time interval.
