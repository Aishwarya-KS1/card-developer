# Overview
This document is an introduction and quick access, how-to guide when learning to use the Fiserv Developer Studio©: Card Developer©.

### Developer Studio Highlights

*	API explorer—An interactive research tools for technical information, key management, and credentials. Located in the lower half of the left-side panel.
*	Create Workspace—Clients create Card Developer Workspace(s). The Card Developer Workspace contains the API keys/Credentials of the Client's company. You can create more workspace types for other purposes.
*	Add API Keys—Clients add API keys to the workspace. The API key and Secret are used to obtain an access token. You must register with Fiserv as a client before you can create API keys for Production environment. Then you must get the API keys approved for Fiserv Production environment. See also, New clients.
  
*Note: We used to refer to the previous API Card Developer portal simply as “app”.*

The following graphics show you a visual representation the highlights outlined above. 

## Validation Environment
The sandbox environment is the developer external testing ground. Clients can mimic the production environment and create simulated responses. The simulated responses are based on test cases and data from Fiserv. The sandbox environment is identical to production but points to a simulated API environment for API responses.

## Note to the Company Administrators

### Migration of Existing API Keys and Company Developers

If you already have API Keys and Company Developers, your existing API Keys and Company Developers can be migrated to the Card Developer Workspace. The system will prompt for your decision to whether migrate the existing API Keys and Company Developers or not.

#### How Existing API Keys and Company Developers Migrated

If you currently have API keys and Company Developers, you can migrate your existing API keys and Company Developers to the Card Developer Workspace.
When the Company Administrator creates a Card Developer Workspace, the Company Administrator must use the same email address used previously to create a new account on Developer Studio.  The system checks for an alpha-numeric match and is case sensitive. 
**Note:** The migrated Company Developers are automatically invited to join the Card Developer Workspace.
