#### Client ID and LOGO
Each registered company must have a clientID and logo unique to the organization. This applies to all third-party providers and existing clients. New organizations to Fiserv are issued a unique clientID and logo that they must use to register the organization on the Card Developer Portal.

#### Manage Apps
In the Card Developer portal, the terms, My Apps or Company Apps, does not directly refer to software applications. No coding or actual call requests are handled from the portal.

Although the portal does communicate with the Card Developer gateway to enable key authentication, developers cannot directly call APIs from the portal. Use other development applications, (e.g., Postman or proprietary software) to make call requests.
