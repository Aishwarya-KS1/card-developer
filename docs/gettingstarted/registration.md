### Registration

Clients need to register with Fiserv and obtain Client ID and LOGO. 

#### Client ID and LOGO
Each registered company must have a Client ID and logo unique to the organization. This applies to all third-party providers and existing clients. New organizations to Fiserv are issued a unique Client ID and logo that they must use when requesting APIs Keys for the Certification environment or the Production environment.

#### Manage Apps
In the Card Developer portal the terms "My Apps" or "Company Apps" do not directly refer to software applications. No coding or actual call requests are handled from the portal.

Although the portal does communicate with the Card Developer gateway to enable key authentication, developers cannot directly call APIs from the portal. Use other development applications, (e.g., Postman or proprietary software) to make call requests.
