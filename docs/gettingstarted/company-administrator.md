### Company Administrator

The Developer Studio Workspace Administrator, also referred to as Company Administrator, is a role intended for a designated primary point of contact for a company who acts as a liaison between Fiserv and the company developers. The Company Administrator manages the company API Keys and developers' access. A lead project developer or architect overseeing other developers are examples of individuals fulfilling this role.

**Step 1** A client establishes the Company Administrator when creating the Card Developer workspace (the creator of the Card Developer workspace is the Administrator). The Company Administrator can then invite developers or invite and other administrators.

**Step 2** Create a Company API Key in the Developer Studio Workspace.

A Sandbox API Key is created automatically upon the Workspace creation. The automatically created Sandbox API Key is visible only to the Workspace Creator (also known as the Workspace Owner). The Company Administrator can manually create one or more Sandbox API Keys in the Developer Studio Workspace for each integration project. The manually created Sandbox API Keys are visible to all the Company Developers invited to the workspace. 
The Company Administrator can also create Production API Keys that are visible to all the Company Developers invited to the Developer Studio Workspace. Each Production API Key supports a set of APIs. The APIs supported by the API Production Key are subject to approval by Fiserv. The approval of the Production APIs is dependent on the subscription agreement developed during the initial client registration process.

**Step 3** Invite developers to the Developer Studio Workspace.
The Company Administrator can invite as many members as necessary to the Developer Studio Workspace. The members need to create Developer Studio account to be invited to the Workspace.
