Production
As a reminder, once the App is promoted to production, Fiserv security team generates customer specific client certificate. The issued certificate will be sent via secure email directly to the registered company admin. This process may take a few days to complete. 

The Fiserv Card Services security team will sent the following (2) secure emails:

(1) email containing the issued certificate file (pfx) and password for the certificate

(2) email with password to open the zip file shared in the first email
