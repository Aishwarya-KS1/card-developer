### Production

As a reminder, once the App is promoted to production the Fiserv security team generates a customer-specific client certificate. The issued certificate will be sent via secure email directly to the registered company admin. This process may take up to ten days to complete. 

The Fiserv Card Services security team will send the following (2) secure emails:

(1) email containing the issued certificate file (pfx) and password for the certificate

(2) email with the password to open the zip file shared in the first email
