### Company Developer

As a Company Developer you can use already existing Sandbox API Keys created by Company Administrators. The Company Developer can test API Keys in the Sandbox environment at any time. Company Developers also get access to the Company Production API Keys created by the Company Administrator.

Please review the prerequisite section below and contact your Company Administrator for questions regarding any Fiserv setup requirements.

 
#### Prerequisites

*  You created an account on Developer Studio.
  
*  Your Company Administrator will invite you as a Company Developer to the Card Developer Workspace. 

*  Upon invite, an email is sent to you with instructions.

*  Ensure the Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLS 1.2) is enforced on your system.

   *  **Also see:** [API Security](?path=/docs/gettingstarted/api_security.md)
  
*  A separate Fiserv x.509 digital certificate is required for the sandbox and production environment, respectively. 

   * Sandbox Client Certificate and corresponding password can be found after you log into your Card Developer Workspace (view the desired Sandbox API Key from the Credentials tab).
