## FAQs

### How did clients previously integrate with our APIs?
Historically Card Services has been able to expose our backend services via Integrated Desktop and traditional XML web services tools. We developed our go-forward digital strategy with our clients and their consumers in mind and determined that an open portal using REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs provides a more optimal API integration experience than the traditional route.

### How do I access the Card Developer portal and use the sandbox? 
You must be a client, client developer, and register through the Developer Portal to be granted test accounts and access to the sandbox.

### What is the overall API strategy as the API Portal evolves?
As the API portal evolves, you will initially find more APIs added from a variety of Fiserv Card Services product lines. These would include Credit, Debit, Risk, as well as the development of new Card Services APIs. Additionally, there is a global initiative to migrate existing services, as well as build new APIs to accommodate the changing needs of the industry across multiple Fiserv business units.

### What problems in the marketplace does our API solution solve?
In this modern age, there are evolving market demands and growing consumer expectations. In the ‘always on’ industry, consumers expect real-time information on any and all selected devices. APIs help meet expectations by allowing a faster way to make products available based on consumer need and the changing needs of business.

### Why use Fiserv APIs?
APIs are targeted at the developers or ‘makers’ of digital solutions. Upon API portal launch, Fiserv will provide a unique key to participating clients, allowing their developers to perform system queries and obtain real-time answers. This new functionality further ensures that consumers have the latest data as well as the best available digital technology.

### Will clients be notified when new APIs are available on the Portal?
Portal clients will receive client communications detailing portal updates and they may be invited to webinars to learn more about Portal offerings.  Card Services will periodically deploy marketing campaigns to create additional awareness of the Portal, available APIs and upcoming enhancements.  As we communicate and campaign to our clients, we will keep you informed with product briefs, talking points and other sales enablement collateral.
